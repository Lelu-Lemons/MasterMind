# MASTERMIND


### INTRO:
- Mastermind is a code breaking board game from the 1970s, based originally on Bulls and Cows and has modern day iterations such as Wordle

### TECH:
- Depends on .NET 8 and MudBlazor 6.15

- Made with Microsoft's Blazor. Styled with MudBlazor components. Making an interactive webapp without javascript has been a blast!

- Game State, Code Generation and checks, and Accessibility Separate into their own Services Scoped to the lifetime of user's session. For future versions, consideration for a Singleton Service for code generation could prove most beneficial in creating a cooperative multiplayer version.

### QUICK START
- run ```dotnet run``` or  ```dotnet watch``` to get started
